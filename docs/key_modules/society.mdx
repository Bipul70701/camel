# Society

## 1. Concept
The society module is one of the core modules of CAMEL. By simulating the information exchange process, this module studies the social behaviors among agents. 

Currently, the society module aims to enable agents to collaborate autonomously toward completing tasks while keeping consistent with human intentions and requiring minimal human intervention. It includes two frameworks: `RolePlaying` and `BabyAGI`, which are used to run the interaction behaviors of agents to achieve objectives.

Taking `RolePlaying` as an example, this framework was designed in an instruction-following manner. These roles independently undertake the responsibilities of executing and planning tasks, respectively. The dialogue is continuously advanced through a turn-taking mechanism, thereby collaborating to complete tasks. The main concepts include:

- **Task**: A task can be as simple as an idea, initialized by an inception prompt.
- **AI User**: The agent who is expected to provide instructions.
- **AI Assistant**: The agent who is expected to respond with solutions that fulfill the instructions.

## 2. Types

### 2.1 `RolePlaying`

`RolePlaying` is a unique cooperative agent framework of CAMEL. Through this framework, agents in CAMEL overcome numerous challenges, such as:

- Role flipping
- Assistant repeats instructions
- Flake replies
- Infinite loop of messages
- Conversation termination conditions

When using the `RolePlaying` framework in CAMEL, predefined prompts are used to create unique initial settings for different agents. For example, if the user wants to initialize an assistant agent, the agent will be initialized with the following prompt:

- Never forget you are a `<ASSISTANT_ROLE>` and I am a `<USER_ROLE>`.
  - *Assigns the chosen role to the assistant agent*
- Never flip roles! Never instruct me!
  - *Prevents role switching*
- You must decline my instruction honestly if you cannot perform the instruction due to physical, moral, legal reasons or your capability and explain the reasons.
  - *Safety mechanism*
- Unless I say the task is completed, you should always start with: **Solution: `<YOUR_SOLUTION>`**
  - *Ensures consistent response format*
- Always end your solution with: **Next request**
  - *Maintains conversation flow*

### 2.2 `BabyAGI`

The BabyAGI framework is adapted from the [Task-driven Autonomous Agent](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) implementation.

## 3. Get Started

### 3.1 Using `RolePlaying`

```python
from colorama import Fore
from camel.societies import RolePlaying
from camel.utils import print_text_animated

def main(model=None, chat_turn_limit=50) -> None:
    # Initialize role-playing session
    task_prompt = "Develop a trading bot for the stock market"
    role_play_session = RolePlaying(
        assistant_role_name="Python Programmer",
        assistant_agent_kwargs={"model": model},
        user_role_name="Stock Trader",
        user_agent_kwargs={"model": model},
        task_prompt=task_prompt,
        with_task_specify=True,
        task_specify_agent_kwargs={"model": model},
    )

    # Display system messages
    print(Fore.GREEN + f"AI Assistant System Message:\n{role_play_session.assistant_sys_msg}\n")
    print(Fore.BLUE + f"AI User System Message:\n{role_play_session.user_sys_msg}\n")

    # Show task progression
    print(Fore.YELLOW + f"Original task prompt:\n{task_prompt}\n")
    print(Fore.CYAN + f"Specified task prompt:\n{role_play_session.specified_task_prompt}\n")
    print(Fore.RED + f"Final task prompt:\n{role_play_session.task_prompt}\n")

    # Start conversation loop
    n = 0
    input_msg = role_play_session.init_chat()
    
    while n < chat_turn_limit:
        n += 1
        assistant_response, user_response = role_play_session.step(input_msg)

        # Check termination conditions
        if assistant_response.terminated:
            print(Fore.GREEN + f"AI Assistant terminated: {assistant_response.info['termination_reasons']}")
            break
        if user_response.terminated:
            print(Fore.GREEN + f"AI User terminated: {user_response.info['termination_reasons']}")
            break

        # Display responses
        print_text_animated(Fore.BLUE + f"AI User:\n{user_response.msg.content}\n")
        print_text_animated(Fore.GREEN + f"AI Assistant:\n{assistant_response.msg.content}\n")

        if "CAMEL_TASK_DONE" in user_response.msg.content:
            break

        input_msg = assistant_response.msg
