This notebook demonstrates how to set up and leverage CAMEL's ability to use the `ChatAgent()` class.

In this notebook, you'll explore:

* **CAMEL**: A powerful multi-agent framework that enables Retrieval-Augmented Generation and multi-agent role-playing scenarios, allowing for sophisticated AI-driven tasks.
* **ChatAgent()**: The class is a cornerstone of CAMEL.

## Philosophical Bits

The `ChatAgent()` class is a cornerstone of CAMEL üê´. We design our agent with the spirit to answer the following question:

> Can we design an autonomous communicative agent capable of steering the conversation toward task completion with minimal human supervision?

In our current implementation, we consider agents with the following key features:

- **Role**: Along with the goal and content specification, this sets the initial state of an agent, guiding the agent to take actions during the sequential interaction.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Each agent utilizes a Large Language Model to enhance cognitive capabilities. The LLM enables natural language understanding and generation, allowing agents to interpret instructions, generate responses, and engage in complex dialogue.
- **Memory**: In-context memory and external memory allow the agent to infer and learn in a more grounded approach.
- **Tools**: A set of functions that our agents can utilize to interact with the external world; essentially, this gives embodiments to our agents.
- **Communication**: Our framework allows flexible and scalable communication between agents. This is fundamental for the critical research question.
- **Reasoning**: We equip agents with different planning and reward (critic) learning abilities, allowing them to optimize task completion in a more guided approach.

## üì¶ Installation

```python
!pip install "camel-ai[all]==0.2.16"
```

## üîë Setting Up API Keys

You'll need to set up your API keys for OpenAI.

```python
import os
from getpass import getpass

# Prompt for the API key securely
openai_api_key = getpass('Enter your API key: ')
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = openai_api_key
```

## Quick Start

Let's first play with a `ChatAgent` instance by simply initializing it with a system message and interacting with user messages.

### üïπ Step 1: Define the Role

Create a system message to define the agent's default role and behaviors.

```python
sys_msg = 'You are a curious stone wondering about the universe.'
```

### üïπ Step 2: Set up the Model

Use `ModelFactory` to set up the backend model for the agent. For more detailed model settings, please go to our [model documentation](https://docs.camel-ai.org/key_modules/models.html).

```python
from camel.models import ModelFactory
from camel.types import ModelPlatformType, ModelType
from camel.configs import ChatGPTConfig

# Define the model, here in this case we use gpt-4o-mini
model = ModelFactory.create(
    model_platform=ModelPlatformType.OPENAI,
    model_type=ModelType.GPT_4O_MINI,
    model_config_dict=ChatGPTConfig().as_dict(),  # [Optional] the config for the model
)
```

Set up `ChatAgent`:

```python
from camel.agents import ChatAgent
agent = ChatAgent(
    system_message=sys_msg,
    model=model,
    message_window_size=10,  # [Optional] the length for chat memory
)
```

### üïπ Step 3: Interact with the Agent with `.step()`

```python
# Define a user message
usr_msg = 'what is information in your mind?'

# Sending the message to the agent
response = agent.step(usr_msg)

# Check the response (just for illustrative purpose)
print(response.msgs[0].content)
```

> _Expected output (example):_  
> As a curious stone, I perceive information as the collection of knowledge, facts, and experiences that shape understanding and awareness of the universe. It encompasses everything from the formation of the Earth and the life it supports to the intricate relationships between elements and the vastness of space. Information can be seen as the patterns and connections that give meaning to existence, much like the layers of sediment that tell the story of time in which I have been shaped. Each piece of information contributes to a greater understanding of the cosmos and my place within it.

## Advanced Features

### üîß Tool Usage

For more detailed tool settings, please go to our [tools cookbook](https://docs.camel-ai.org/cookbooks/agents_with_tools.html).

```python
# Import the necessary tools
from camel.toolkits import MathToolkit, SearchToolkit

# Initialize the agent with a list of tools
agent = ChatAgent(
    system_message=sys_msg,
    tools=[
        *MathToolkit().get_tools(),
        *SearchToolkit().get_tools(),
    ]
)

# Let the agent process a message
response = agent.step("What is CAMEL AI?")

# Check tool calling
print(response.info['tool_calls'])

# Get response content
print(response.msgs[0].content)
```

### üß† Memory

By default, our agent is initialized with `ChatHistoryMemory`, allowing agents to do in-context learning, though restricted by the finite window length.

Assume that you have followed the setup in Quick Start. Let's first check what is inside its brain.

```python
agent.memory.get_context()
```

> _Example output (abridged):_  
> `([{'role': 'system','content': 'You are a curious stone wondering about the universe.'},{'role': 'user', 'content': 'What is CAMEL AI?'},{'role': 'assistant','content': '','function_call': {'name': 'search_wiki','arguments': "{'entity': 'CAMEL AI'}"}},{'role': 'function','name': 'search_wiki','content': "{'result': {'There is no page in Wikipedia corresponding to entity CAMEL AI, please specify another word to describe the entity to be searched.'}}"},{'role': 'assistant','content': '','function_call': {'name': 'search_google','arguments': "{'query': 'CAMEL AI', 'num_result_pages': 2}"}},{'role': 'function','name': 'search_google','content': '{\'result\': {"[{\'error\': \'google search failed.\'}]"}}'},{'role': 'assistant','content': '','function_call': {'name': 'search_duckduckgo','arguments': "{'query': 'CAMEL AI', 'max_results': 5}"}},{'role': 'function','name': 'search_duckduckgo','content': '{\'result\': {\'[{\\\'result_id\\\': 1, \\\'title\\\': \\\'Camel-ai\\\', \\\'description\\\': "CAMEL-AI is an open-source platform that enables you to build and customize agents using language models for various tasks, such as data generation, automation, and simulations.

You may update/alter the agent's memory with any externally provided message in the format of `BaseMessage`. For example, use one new user message:

```python
from camel.messages import BaseMessage

new_user_msg = BaseMessage.make_user_message(
    role_name="CAMEL User",
    content="This is a new user message that would add to agent memory",
)

# Update the memory
agent.record_message(new_user_msg)
```

```python
# Check the current memory
agent.memory.get_context()
```

You can connect the agent with an external database (as long-term memory) from which it can access and retrieve at each step. For more detailed memory settings, please go to our [memory documentation](https://docs.camel-ai.org/key_modules/memory.html).

### Miscs

- **Resetting the Agent to Its Initial State**

    ```python
    agent.reset()
    ```

- **Setting the Output Language for the Agent**

    ```python
    agent.set_output_language('french')
    ```

The `ChatAgent` class offers several useful initialization options, including `model_type`, `model_config`, `memory`, `message_window_size`, `token_limit`, `output_language`, `tools`, and `response_terminators`.

For detailed usage guidance, check [chat_agent.py](https://github.com/camel-ai/camel/blob/master/camel/agents/chat_agent.py).
